        <h2>About SPEEM</h2>
        <p>Welcome to SPEEM, the Serverless Private Encrypted End-to-End Messaging app designed with your privacy in mind. SPEEM ensures that your communications are secure and private, without relying on centralized servers.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>SPEEM aims to provide a truly private messaging experience. By eliminating the need for centralized servers, we ensure that your data remains in your hands. Our architecture allows for peer-to-peer communication, encrypted messaging, and secure key management all within the app itself.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Key Features</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Fully serverless architecture for maximum privacy.</li>
            <li>End-to-end encryption to secure your messages.</li>
            <li>Peer-to-peer messaging without centralized servers.</li>
            <li>Secure key generation and storage on your device.</li>
            <li>User pairing through QR codes or local network discovery.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

        <h2>Roadmap</h2>
        <p>We are currently in the development phase and are working towards our Proof of Concept (PoC) version. Our roadmap includes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>PoC Version:</strong> Basic functionalities including secure registration, key generation, and peer-to-peer messaging.</li>
            <li><strong>Version 1 (V1):</strong> Enhanced features like message queuing, push notifications, user presence, and decentralized discovery.</li>
            <li><strong>Future Versions:</strong> Continuous improvements based on user feedback, enhanced security protocols, and more features to ensure the best private messaging experience.</li>

        <h2>Performance and Usability</h2>
        <p>At SPEEM, we are committed to providing maximum performance and usability for our users. To achieve this, we have chosen Rust for our core cryptographic and networking functionalities. Rust's memory safety and performance characteristics make it an ideal choice for building secure and efficient applications.</p>
        <p>By utilizing Rust as a shared library, we ensure that our code is both robust and performant. Additionally, we are developing native mobile apps for both iOS and Android, which allows us to leverage the full capabilities of each platform and provide a seamless user experience.</p>
        <p>This approach enables us to combine the best of both worlds: the safety and speed of Rust, along with the native performance and usability of platform-specific mobile development.</p>
