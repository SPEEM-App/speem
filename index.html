        <h2>Performance and Usability</h2>
        <p>At SPEEM, we are committed to providing maximum performance and usability for our users. To achieve this, we have chosen Rust for our core cryptographic and storage functionalities. Rust's memory safety and performance characteristics make it an ideal choice for building secure and efficient applications.</p>
        <p>By utilizing Rust for both business logic and the graphical user interface, we ensure that our code is both robust and performant. Additionally, we will develop native applications for major desktop operating systems, followed by mobile apps, to leverage the full capabilities of each platform and provide a seamless user experience.</p>
        <p>This approach enables us to combine the best of both worlds: the safety and speed of Rust, along with a user-friendly and performant application.</p>
