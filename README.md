# SPEEM - Secure Papers and Encrypted Educational Manuscripts

## :warning: :construction: Under Active Development :construction: :warning:

The SPEEM project is still in early stages and very much a work in progress. More features will be added,
docs may be missing or outdated and api/config may change.

## Introduction
Welcome to SPEEM, the blockchain-based platform designed for secure storage, management, and verification of academic research papers. Utilizing Substrate's flexible blockchain framework, SPEEM ensures the provenance, integrity, and verifiability of academic publications, fostering a trustworthy and accessible knowledge base.

## Mission
Our mission is to empower the academic community by providing a decentralized solution that enhances the transparency and security of scholarly publications. Through SPEEM, universities and research centers can participate as network validators, contributing to and securing the network, thus ensuring the integrity and immutability of the academic records.

## Key Features
- **Secure and Tamper-proof Storage**: Utilizes blockchain to ensure that all academic papers are stored securely and remain immutable.
- **Provenance and Integrity**: Each document's origin and edits are verifiable through cryptographic proofs, maintaining a clear and auditable trail.
- **Decentralized Validation**: Enables academic institutions to act as validators, fostering a community-driven approach to managing and safeguarding academic content.
- **Transparency and Accessibility**: Ensures that all transactions and document submissions are transparent and accessible to authorized users, promoting a culture of openness and peer review.

## Development Roadmap
### Phase 1: Proof of Concept (PoC)
- Develop core blockchain logic for secure document handling.
- Implement basic functionality for document submission and cryptographic verification.
- Establish a minimal viable product to demonstrate concept feasibility.

### Version 1: Full Feature Release
- Expand features to include comprehensive document management and validation.
- Integrate additional blockchain-based functionalities for enhanced academic collaboration.
- Deploy a user-friendly interface tailored for academic users.

## Decentralized Computing and Blockchain Benefits
Utilizing decentralized computing with blockchain technology is foundational to SPEEM, making it ideal for environments such as universities and research centers. As validators, these institutions help secure and maintain the network, enhancing trust and transparency. Benefits include:
- **Immutability**: Ensures academic records cannot be altered after being recorded.
- **Transparency**: Provides visibility into the lifecycle of each document.
- **Security**: Protects against unauthorized access and fraud using advanced cryptographic techniques.
- **Decentralization**: Empowers institutions to participate in governance, democratizing academic content management.

Substrate's advanced blockchain framework supports these decentralized applications, offering the flexibility and robustness needed for SPEEM.

## Contributions
SPEEM is currently a work in progress. We are excited about community contributions! While the initial development up to v1 is being carried out internally, we eagerly anticipate and welcome community contributions post-v1 release. Once there, please feel free to fork the repository, and prepare pull requests for features you believe would enhance the SPEEM toolkit.
