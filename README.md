# SPEEM - Substrate & Pallet Engineering & Environment Management

## Introduction
Welcome to SPEEM, the integrated development environment designed for enhancing the productivity and capabilities of Substrate blockchain developers. This tool focuses on providing robust development and testing utilities tailored specifically for Substrate and FRAME pallets, facilitating a streamlined workflow for blockchain creation and management.

## About SPEEM
SPEEM (Substrate & Pallet Engineering & Environment Management) is a comprehensive toolkit aimed at simplifying the complexities of Substrate blockchain development. It integrates various features essential for configuring, testing, and managing Substrate blockchains and their components.

## Mission
Our mission is to empower developers with an advanced set of tools that streamline the development process of Substrate-based blockchains. SPEEM aims to reduce the overhead associated with the blockchain development lifecycle, from initial configuration to deployment and testing.

## Key Features
- **Environment Management**: Manage and customize local Substrate development environments easily.
- **Pallet Configuration Panels**: Configure and manage the behavior of different FRAME pallets interactively.
- **Real-Time Monitoring and Logging**: Monitor blockchain events and system logs in real time.
- **Integration Testing Tools**: Conduct comprehensive integration tests that simulate real-world scenarios and interactions between multiple pallets.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Navigate through complex development tasks with an intuitive user interface.

## Development Phases
SPEEM's development is planned to roll out in phases:
- **Phase 1: Proof of Concept (PoC)** - Focus on core functionalities including pallet configuration and event monitoring.
- **Future Releases**: Will introduce more advanced features, enhancing the tool to support broader integration and testing capabilities.

We aim to develop SPEEM in a way that it continues to serve as a vital tool for all Substrate developers, adapting to new challenges and requirements of blockchain technology.

## Contributions
SPEEM is currently a work in progress. We are excited about community contributions! While the initial development up to v1 is being carried out internally, we eagerly anticipate and welcome community contributions post-v1 release. Once there, please feel free to fork the repository, and prepare pull requests for features you believe would enhance the SPEEM toolkit.

## FAQ
- **Why startung this project**: Simple, I just wanted to learn Substrate and FRAME pallet developmnet as deep as possible, so I decided to build tooling around them in order to better understand them. 
- **Why that name (Substrate & Pallet Engineering & Environment Management)**: I already owned the speem.app domain name, so I did what I can to match the names. And hey, did you look at what FRAME means?.
