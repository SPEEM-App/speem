## Performance and Usability

At SPEEM, we are committed to providing maximum performance and usability for our users. To achieve this, we have chosen Rust for our core cryptographic and networking functionalities. Rust's memory safety and performance characteristics make it an ideal choice for building secure and efficient applications.

By utilizing Rust as a shared library, we ensure that our code is both robust and performant. Additionally, we are developing native mobile apps for both iOS and Android, which allows us to leverage the full capabilities of each platform and provide a seamless user experience.

This approach enables us to combine the best of both worlds: the safety and speed of Rust, along with the native performance and usability of platform-specific mobile development.
